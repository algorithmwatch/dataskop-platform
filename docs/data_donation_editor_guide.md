# Guide for Data Donation Editors

Here will be a guide for people who run data donation projects on dataskop.net. We cam them *editors* (in German: *Redakteur/in*).

## Create a new data donation campaign (project)

[TODO]

## Send reminders to people 

Right now, we do not send reminders automatically to donors who didn't verified.
To go the admin view of all donations and choose an admin aciton.
If you don't choose single donations, all donations will get checked. (Only emails to unverified emails will get send.)

## Send a custom notification to all people who contributed to a campaign

1. Create a new `donor notification`
2. Choose a campaign, leave `draft=True`.
3. If you hit save, the email will get send to your email as a draft. It will get send on every update.
4. Finally send the email to all users by setting `draft=False`. The email will get send and can't be changed anymore.

## Delete unverified donations

Right now, we don't delete unverified donations automatically.
Go to admin action and select the records (e.g. via filter), then choose the admin action. (Only records that should really be deleted get deleted.)

## An overview of the current donations
